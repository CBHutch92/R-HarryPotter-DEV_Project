# About the R Harry Potter Project

# The project was completed and the code was written by me, with the central problem presented to us from our professor in my Data Exploration and Visualization course (MATH 3440).
# I received an A for this project

# The project was based off of a fictional employee who works for the Ministry of Magic in the Harry Potter world to compare Order and Dark Arts activity.
